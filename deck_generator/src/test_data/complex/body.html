<p>Division of two polynomials  works in 2 seperate ways.</p>
<h2>1. Long Division</h2>
<p>Say we want to divide [$]x^2 - 4x + 2[/$]) by [$]x-2[/$]) how would be do that?</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the first term (in this case [$]x^2[/$])) and check what factor m you need to multiply the divisor ([$]x[/$])) by in order for the to equal 0 when subtracted (in this case x)</li>
<li>Multiply the whole divisor ([$]x-2[/$])) by m ([$]x<em>m-2</em>m[/$]))</li>
<li>Subtract the result from the polynomial (or switch all signs and at, it's the same)</li>
<li>Write the next term of the polynomial into the next line (just like with normal long division)</li>
<li>Repeat step one until there are no terms left.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2. Synthetic Division</h2>
<p>If the divisor is in the form [$]x-c[/$]) then synthetic division is possible.
Synthetic division works like the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>c</th>
<th>[$]a_n[/$])</th>
<th>[$]a_{n-1}[/$])</th>
<th>â€¦</th>
<th>[$]a_0[/$])</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>[$]r_n*c[/$])</td>
<td></td>
<td>[$]r_1*c[/$])</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>r_n=a_n</td>
<td>[$]r_{n-1}=r_n+a_{n-1}[/$])</td>
<td></td>
<td>$r_n=r_{n-1}*c</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>= coeff n</td>
<td>=coeff n-1</td>
<td></td>
<td>= Remainder</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This yields the new coefficients for the result (quotient) of the division.</p>
