# How can complex numbers be visualized?
The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ [[20240910112146]] can be visualized as an array in the Gaussian number plain, 
where the real part a and the imaginary part b act as the coordinates of the tip.

The length of this array is also called its absolute value $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + \^2} of z 
and the angle to the real axis is called its argument $\varphi = arg(z)$.
The argument is defined as a whole-numbered multiple of $2\pi$ ($\mod 2\pi$).
Using the functions $\sin$ and $\cos$ the complex number $z=a+ib$ with its real and imaginary
part can be related to its polar coordinates.

$a = r \cos \varphi, b = r \sin \varphi$
or
$r^2 = a^2 + b^2, tan \varphi = \frac{b}{a}$
