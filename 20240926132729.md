# What rules are there for derivating? 
There are many rules for derivatives [[20240926131117]], which can be derived from the differntialquotient. 
1. Additive constants drop away $f'(x)$ of $f(x)=2x+k$ is $f'(x)=2$
2. $f'$ of $f=x^n$ is $f'(x)=n*x$
3. $f'$ of $f=x$ is $f'(x)=1$
4. sin and cos
    - $f'$ of $f=sin(x)$ is $cos(x)$
    - $f'$ of $f=cos(x)$ is $-sin(x)$
    - $f'$ of $f = -sin(x)$ is $-cos(x)$
    - $f'$ of $f=-cos(x)$ is $sin(x)$
5. Multiplication rule
       $f'$ of $f=g(x)*h(x)$ is $g(x)*h'(x)+g'(x)*h(x)$

6. Division rule
   The division rule is similar to the Multiplication rule.
   $f'$ of $f=\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$ is $\frac{g'(x)*h(x)-g(x)*h'(x)}{h^2(x)}$

7. Chain rule
   $f'$ of $f=g(h(x))$ is $g'(h(x))*h'(x)$
