# What happens when solving quadratic equations with complex number coefficients?
Like with real numbers [[20240910111450]] the quadratic equation with complex number [[20240910112146]] coefficients (polynomial of degree 2 [[20240920124236]]) produces two possible solutions, except for, when the discriminant ($p^2-4q$) is 0 (we get 1 solution, or two equal ones).
What is different to the real numbers is, that we no longer care about the sign of the expression under the root.
If it is negative we just have $i$ in the solution.
