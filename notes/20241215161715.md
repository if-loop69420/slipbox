# What can you say about a function if all derivatives up to n-1 are 0 for $f(x_0)$? 

If all derivatives[[20240926131117]] $f^{(n)}(x_0)$ are 0 up to $n-1$ the following apply:
- If n is even, then $f$ in $x_0$ is a local maxima if $f^{(n)}(x_0) < 0$ and a local minima otherwise

- If n is odd, then $f$ at $x_0$ is strictly monotonously falling if $f^{(n)}(x_0) < 0$ and rising otherwise

This relates to the taylor series [[20241123141048]].
