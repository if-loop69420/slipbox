# What is a vector? 
A column vector in an n-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^n$ has the following form:
$x=\left(\begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ … \\ x_n \end{array}\right)$, where $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the real number coordinates. 

More generally for a field [[20241126093518]] $K$ the n-dimensional space $K^n$  consists of vectors $x$ with coordinates $x_1, x_2, … , x_n \in K$. The field $K$ is called the Scalar field and the elements are called scalars.
