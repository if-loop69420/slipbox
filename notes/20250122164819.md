# When is a function totally differentiable? 
A function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is called totally differentiable if there exists a linear projection [[20241216115516]] $L: \R^n \to \R^m$, that approximates the derivative[[20240926131117]] of that function (meaning the error function is sublinear).
