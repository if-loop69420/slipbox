# How to find a particular solution to a second order LDE with constant coefficients? 
To find the particular solution to a second order LDE [[20250127105253]] with constant coefficients $y'' + y' \cdot b + y \cdot a  = s(x)$ you first find the homogenous solution [[20250127105753]] $y'' + y' \cdot b + y \cdot a = 0$ and then check which of the following forms the function $s(x)$ has and use that to find a particular solution.


| $s(x)$ | Solution $y_p(x)$ |
|--------|-------------------|
| $1$ | $A$ |
| $e^rx$ | $Ae^rx$ |
| $sin(rx)$ or $cos(rx)$ | $Asin(rx)+Bcos(rx)$ |
| $a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2...$ | $A_0 + A_1x + A_2 x^2...$ |
| $(a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+...)e^rx$ | $A_0 + A_1x+A_2x^2...)e^rx$ |
