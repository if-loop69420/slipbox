# What is a group? 
A group is a Monoid[[20240929155957]]M , that has an operation $\sigma: M \times M \mapsto M$, that is not only associative, but also has an inverse element.
Respective to a set this means having the following attributes: 
1. The operation $\sigma$ has to be associative
2. The set has to have a neutral element $e$ with respect to the operation $\sigma(a,e)=a$
3. Every element in the set has to have an inverse element $a^{-1}$, so that $a*a^{-1}=e$
4. If the operation on the set is commutative the group is called abelian.
