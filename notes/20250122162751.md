# What is Schwarz' theorem? 
Schwarz' theorem states, that partially derivating[[20250122162007]] a function $f(x,y)$ first by $x$ and then by $y$, or the other way around yields the same result.

$f_{xy}(x,y)=f_{yx}(x,y)$.

This applies to any amount of variables $f_{xyz}(x,y,z) = f_{xzy}(x,y,z)$.
