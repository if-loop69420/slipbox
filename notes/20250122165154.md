# What is the directional derivative of a function? 
The directional derivative[[20240926131117]] of a function $f: \R^n \to \R$ is a function, that calculates the change of that function in the direction of a vector $v$.

It is defined as a limit $D_v f(\underline{x})=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h*v)-f(x)}{h}$ if it exists.
