# What is a linear projection? 
Let $A$ be a matrix[[20241216113329]] in $K^{m \times n}$ and the relation[[20241030120213]] $x \in K^n \to f(x) = A*x \in K^m$. This relation $f: K^n \to K^m$ has the following properties:
1. $f(x+y) = A(x+y) = A*x + A*y = f(x) * f(y)$,
2. $f(\lambda x) = A(\lambda x) = \lambda (A*x) = \lambda f(x)$

A relation with these properties is called a linear projection.

A projection $f: V \to W$ between two vector spaces [[20241209090550]] $V,W$ over the same field [[20241126093518]] $K$ is called linear if it fulfills the following properties:
1. $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$
2. $f(\lambda x) = \lambda f(x)$
