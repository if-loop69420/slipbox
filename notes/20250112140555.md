# What is the majorant criterea for integrals? 
The majorant criteria for integrals [[20250112140636]] states the following.
If there is an integral $\int_a^b f(x)$ and an integral $g(x) >=0$ $\int_a^b g(x)$, so that $|\int_a^b f(x)| â‰¤ \int_a^b g(x)$ and $g(x)$ converges, then $f(x)$ also converges. If $|\int_a^b f(x)| > \int_a^b g(x)$ then $f(x)$ diverges. $g(x)$ is called the majorant of $f(x)$.
