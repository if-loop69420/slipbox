# What is a mealy automaton? 
Mealy automatons are a special case of transducers [[20250109105031]].

They are defined using a 6-tuple $\{Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta, \gamma, q_0\}$:
- $Q, \Sigma, \delta$ and $q_0$ are the same as in a DEA [[20250108112711]]
- $\Gamma$ is the output alphabet
- $\gamma: Q \times \Sigma \to \Gamma$ is the output function

Mealy automatons have the following properties:
- They are deterministic
- All states are end(final) states
- They have a translation-function [[20250109111816]]
