# When is a function injective? 
A function $f(x)$ [[20240920132211]] is injective if the following logical statement is true
$f(x_1)=f(x_2)\implies x_1=x_2$, which means, that distinct inputs produce distinct outputs, or 
"Two outputs can only be the same if they were produced from the same inputs"
