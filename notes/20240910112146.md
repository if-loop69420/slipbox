# What are complex numbers?
Complex numbers are an extension of the real numbers $\R$ [[20240910111450]] for the purpose of being able to solve 
the equation $x^2 = -1$.  To do this they extend the real numbers by a number $i$ which is defined as $i^2 = -1$.
The complex numbers can thus be defined as $\mathbb{C} = \R + i | i = \sqrt{-1}$.

A complex number is always made up of two parts $z = a + i*b | a,b \in \R$ where a is called the real part and b is called the imaginary part.
