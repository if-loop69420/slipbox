# What is an extended system matrix? 
An extended system matrix is an extension of the matrix of a linear equation system [[20241226105759]]. 
Here the "b" is written in the following form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} x_1 & a_{12} x_2 & ... & a_{1n} x_n & \mid b_1 \\
a_{21} x_1 & a_{22} x_2 & ... & a_{2n} x_n & \mid b_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \mid \vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 & a_{m2} x_2 & ... & a_{mn} x_n & \mid b_m  
\end{pmatrix}
$$
This matrix is also sometimes called $A$ $b$.
