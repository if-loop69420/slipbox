# When is a polynomial irreducible? 
A polynomial $p$ [[20240920124236]] over a field [[20241126093518]] $\mathbb{K}$ is irreducible, if there are no polynomials of degree $â‰¤ deg(p)/2$, that divide it. That means that polynomials of degrees 2 and 3 are only irreducible, if they have no zeroes (in the field $\mathbb{K}$).

A polynomial of degree $deg(p)$ is divisible by a polynomial of degree $deg(p) - m$ if it is divisible by a polynomial of degree $m$.
