# What is a non-deterministic finite automaton? 
A non-deterministic finite automaton is a finite automaton[[20250108112505]], but non-deterministic means, that there are $\epsilon$-transitions and a combination of current state and input can produce multiple next states.

A non-deterministic finite automaton is described as a 5-tuple $\textit{A}=(Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$. Everything except $\delta$ is the same as in the tuple describing a deterministic finite automaton [[20250108112711]].
$\delta$ is defined as $\delta \subset Q\times (\Sigma \cap \{\epsilon\})\times Q$, which is called the transition relation[[20241030120213]].
