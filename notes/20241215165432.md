# What is de l'Hospital's rule? 
The rule states, that if the limit $\lim \frac{f}{g}$ of two functions $f$ and $g$ is an unknown form ($\frac{0}{0}$, or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, or any other unknown form), then you can use the limit of their derivatives [[20240926131117]] $\lim \frac{f'}{g'}$ to find the limit.
