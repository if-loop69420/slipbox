# What is a proof?
A proof is a formal way of expressing a statement to be true based on logic [[20240910103234]] and reasoning.
For this purpose proofs make use of axioms [[20240910103501]] on which they base their reasoning.

"Mathematics as a field of science tries to scientifically prove the most facts about the universe while using the smallest possible number of axioms" - Einstein (probably not a word for word quote)
