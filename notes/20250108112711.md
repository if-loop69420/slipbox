# What is a deterministic finite automaton? 
A deterministic finite automaton is a finite automaton [[20250108112505]] described by a 5-tuple.
deterministic means, that depending on the current state and the input the next state is always known.

The 5 tuple is the following $\textit{A}=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0, F)$:
- $Q$: finite set of states
- $\Sigma:$input alphabet (allowed symbols)
- $\delta: Q\times \Sigma$: set of transitions between the states
- $q_0 \in Q$: start states
- $F\subset Q$: final states
