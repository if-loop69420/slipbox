# What is a Jacobi(functional)-matrix ? 
A jacobi(functional) matrix[[20241216113329]] is a $m\times n$ matrix constructed by building all partial derivatives [[20250122162007]] of a function $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$.

If $f$ is totally differentiable, then the jacobi matrix is the linear projection[[20241216115516]], that represents the first derivative of $f$.
