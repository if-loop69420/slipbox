# What is the transposed matrix of a matrix? 
The transposed matrix $A^T$ of a matrix[[20241216113329]] $A \in K^{m \times n}$$ is a matrix, that is turned 90Â° from the original matrix, or in other words a matrix where columns and rows are swapped.

## Example
The transposed matrix $A^{\tau}$ of the following matrix $A$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 4 \\
2 & 5 \\
3 & 6
\end{pmatrix}
