# What is pascals triangle?
Pascals triangle is a way of representing the coefficients for the binomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$. It is constructed by first writing down a 1 on the top middle.
Then you go to the next row and add the two elements left and right directly above (in case of the second row $0+1$) the number you want to compute.
This goes on for ever and ever resulting in a structure, that looks something like this ![Pascals triangle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Pascal%27s_triangle_5.svg/200px-Pascal%27s_triangle_5.svg.png)
