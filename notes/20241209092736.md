# What is a linear combination? 
Let $v_1, v_2, â€¦, v_n$ be the elements of a vector space [[20241209090550]] $V$ over a field[[20241126093518]] $K$ and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n \in K$. The sum 
$\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i v_i$ is called the linear combination of the vectors $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$. The $\lambda$s are called the coefficients.
It is called trivial if all coefficients are 0 and non-trivial, if that's not the case.
