# What is a partial derivative? 
A partial derivative of a function $f(x_0, x_1,...)$, or $f(\begin{pmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{pmatrix})$ is the calculation of a derivative[[20240926131117]] with respect to one of the variables 
$x_k (0 \le k \le n)$.

It is written as $f_{x_k}(x_0,x_1,...)$ or if multiple of the derivatives are chained together $f_{x_{k1}, x_{k2}}(x_0,x_1,...)$.
