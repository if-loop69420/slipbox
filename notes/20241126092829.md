# What is a ring? 
An algebraic structure [[20241111100144]] $(R,+,*)$ (with two binary operations) is called __Ring__ if: 

- $(R,+)$ is a commutative group [[20240929160535]] (abelian?) (with neutral element 0)
- $(R,*)$ is a semigroup
- and the distributive properties are fulfilled $\forall a,b,c \in R: a*(b+c)=a*b+a*c, (a+b)*c=a*c+b*c$.

If $R$ has a neutral element for $*$ (so it is a monoid), then it is called a ring with an identity element. If it is commutative for $*$, then it is called a commutative ring.
