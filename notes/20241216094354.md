# What is the canonical base of a vector space? 
The canonical baseof a vector space[[20241209090550]] $V$ is a subset $B\subset V$, that is not only a base[[20241215172513]]  of $V$, but also has the following structure (each column is a vector): 

$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & ... & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & ... & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & ... & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.
