# What is a moore automaton? 
A moore automaton is a finite automaton[[20250108112505]], that is almost a special case of a transducer [[20250109105031]].

It is described using a 6-Tuple $\{Q,\Sigma, \Gamma, \delta,\gamma,q_0\}$:
- $Q,\Sigma,\delta$ and $q_0$ are the same as with DEAs [[20250108112711]]
- $\Gamma$ is the output-alphabet
- $\gamma: Q \to \Gamma$ is the output function

It has an extended output function $\gamma^\ast$ and a translation function.

Moore automatons have the following properties:
- Only one start state
- All transitions from a state produce the same output
- The transition-relation $\delta$ is deterministic
- All states are end(final) states
