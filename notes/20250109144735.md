# What is a Büchi-Automaton? 
A büchi atomaton is a deterministic automaton[[20250108112711]], that accepts words of infinite length under certain conditions.

It is (like a DEA) specified using a 5-Tuple $\{Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0, F\}$.

$\Sigma^w$ is the set of the infinite words over $\Sigma$.

It accepts a word $w$  of length $i$, if…
- $w_0$ (the first symbol of w) is accepted by the start state $q_0$
- there is a $(q_{i-1},s_i)=q_i\in \delta$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$
- there are infinitely many $i$, so that  $q_i$ is a final state
