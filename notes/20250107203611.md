# How can the determinant be calculated? 
There are two ways to calculate a determinant [[20250107202540]]:
1. By using the elementary transformations [[20241216112826]] to transform the matrix into a triangle matrix and multiplying the elements of the diagonal
2. By using the following recursive formula:
    1. $det(A) = a_{11}$ if $n=1$
    2. $det(A)=a_{i1}(-1)^{i+1}det(A^{i1})+a_{i2}(-1)^{i+2}det(A^{i2})+...+a_{in}(-1)^{i+n}det(A^{in})$ where $A^{ij}$ is a $n-1\times n-1$-matrix where the i-th column and the j-th row have been removed.
