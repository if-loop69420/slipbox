# What is the gamma function? 
The gamma function is a function[[20240920132211]] defined by the following integral [[20241215165932]]:

$\Gamma(x) \int_0^{\infty}e^{-t}t^{x-1}dt$
Interestingly this function is the equivalent of $f(x)=x!$, which is only defined on the natural numbers, while this works for $\mathbb R^+$.
