# How does the determinant change when applying the elementary transformation?

The determinant[[20250107202540]] of a matrix[[20241216113329]] $A$ changes in the following ways, when applying the elementary transformations[[20241216112826]]:
- Swapping two rows(columns) changes the sign of the determinant
- multiplying a single column with a scalar $k$ multiplies the determinant with $k$
- addition of a multiple of a row(column) doesn't affect the determinant.
