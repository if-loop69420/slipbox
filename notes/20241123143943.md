# What is a square in a BDD? 
A square in a BDD [[20241123143452]] refers to a node in a BDD, that has a value $v$, that can be expressed as $ww$ (so $v$ is symmetric).

e.g. $1001 1001$ is a square.

Instead of writing down the whole thing you can skip splitting $ww$ and just write down $w$ as a node.
