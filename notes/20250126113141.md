# What does a Taylor series in $\R^2$ look like?
Let $D \subset \R$ be an open set and $f: D \to \R$ a n+1-times continuously differentiable function on $D$. Also lt $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x,y)=(x_0+th, y_0+tk)$ be two points so that the line connecting them is fully in $D$. Then there is a $\xi \in (0,1)$, so that

$f(x,y)=f(x_0,y_0)+\sum_{l=1}^n + \frac{(h D_x + k D_y)^l f(x_0,y_0)}{l!}+\frac{(hD_x + kD_y)^n+1f(x_0+\xi h, y_0 + \xi k)}{(n+1)!}$.

If f is infinitely continuously differentiable, then the Taylor series[[20241123141048]] of f is:
$f(x_0,y_0) + \sum_{l=1}^\infty \frac{1}{l!}(hD_x +kD_y)^l f(x_0,y_0)$.

It converges if the series of remainders is a zero-sequence.
