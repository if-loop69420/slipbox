# What is substitution for integration? 
Substitution refers to the integration[[20241215165932]] technique of substituting a part of the function for a stand-in (most commonly $u$) and then integrating under that stand-in before resubstituting the originally substituted part back in.

## Example: $\int tan(x) dx$
$tan(x)=\frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$, so $\int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}dx$ is our goal.
Now we can substitute $u= cos(x)$. Now we have to calculate the derivative $\frac{du}{dx}=-sin(x)$, so $du=-sin(x)dx$.
With this in mind $\int \frac{sin(x) dx}{cos(x)}$ becomes $\int \frac{-du}{u}$, or $\int \frac{-1}{u}du$, which is $-ln|u|+C$.
Now we resubstitute $u$ for $cos(x)$ and we get $-ln|cos(x)|+C$
