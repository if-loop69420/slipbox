# What is a transducer? 
A transducer is a finite automaton [[20250108112505]], that can produce outputs depending on the input and the current state.

It is described as a 6-Tuple $\textit{A}=\{Q,\Sigma,\Gamma\,\delta,I,F\}$:
- $Q, \Sigma$ and $F$ are the same as in a DEA [[20250108112711]].
- $\Gamma$ is the output alphabet
- $\delta \subset Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\})\times \{\Gamma \cup \{\varepsilon\}\} \times Q$ is the transition relation
- $I \sub Q$ are the start states

A transducer has the following properties: 
- It is a finite automaton[[20250108112505]] with inputs and outputs
- The output can depend on state and input
- It acts non-deterministically
    - Transition relation(instead of function)
    - $\varepsilon$-transitions
    - Multiple start states
- Multiple end states
- Instead of a language a finite automaton defines a translation relation [[20250109110044]].
