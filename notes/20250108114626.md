# What are the advantages and disadvantages between NEA and DEA?
The advantages of NEAs[[20250108113610]] and DEAs[[20250108112711]] when comparing one-another are the following:
- NEAs are more flexible
    - multiple next-states to one state and input
    - state and input don't __have__ to produce a next-state
    - transitions without input possible ($\varepsilon$-transition)
- DEAs and NEAs have the same expressivity
- NEAs usually need far fewer states
- NEAs are easier to model
- DEAs are more efficient when running
