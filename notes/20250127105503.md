# How to solve second order LDEs with constant coefficients? 
Second order LDEs [[20250127105253]] with constant coefficients can be solved using the same equation as when solving first order LDEs [[20250126120353]] $y(x) = y_h(x)+y_p(x)$. Now we need to find the homogenous and the particular solution to the second order LDE.
