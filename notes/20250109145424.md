# What is a non-deterministic Büchi Automaton?
A non-deterministic Büchi automaton is a non-deterministic automaton[[20250108113610]], that accepts infinite words under certain conditions.

It is described as a 5-Tuple (Just like the NEA) $\{Q,\Sigma,\delta,I,F\}$.

$\Sigma^w$ is the set of infinite words accepted by a non-deterministic Büchi Automaton.

A word $w$ of length $i$ is accepted if...
- it has a fitting start state $q_0$ for $w_0$
- there is a $\delta(q_{i-1},s_i,q_i)$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$
- there are infinitely many i, so that $q_i$ is a final state
