# What is the signum function for symmetry groups? 
The signum function for symmetry groups [[20241123124618]] is a function defined as the following: 
$\pi: \{1,2,3,...,n\} \to \{1,2,3,...,n\}$ 
$sgn(\pi)=\prod_{1<=i<=j<=n} \frac{\pi(j)-\pi(i)}{j-i}$.

## For two permutations $\pi, \sigma \in S_n$
$$
sgn(\pi \circ \sigma) = \prod_{1<=i<=j<=n} \frac{(\pi \circ \sigma)(j)-(\pi \circ \sigma)(i)}{j-i} =\prod_{1<=i<=j<=n} \frac{\pi(\sigma(j))-\pi(\sigma(i))}{\sigma(j)-\sigma(i)} * \prod_{1<=i<=j<=n} \frac{\sigma(j)-\sigma(i)}{j-i} =sgn(\pi)*sgn(\sigma)
