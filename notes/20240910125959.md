# Quadratic Equations with complex numbers
Quadratic equations with complex numbers [[20240910112146]]
$z^2 + p z + q = 0$
are solved the same way as normal quadratic equations: 
$z_{1,2}= -\frac{p}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{p^2}{4}-q}$

Quadratic equations can also be expressed as $z^2 + pz + q = (z-z_1)(z-z_2)$.
When comparing the coefficients of the potencies of z you receive vieta's root theorem:
$p = -(z_1 + z_2), q=z_1 z_2$
