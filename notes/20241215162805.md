# What is convexity/concavity of a function? 
Convexity and concavity of a function[[20240920132211]] refers to the following: 

- A function is called convex in an interval $I$ if for all $x,y \in I$ and all $\lambda: 0 < \lambda < 1$ 
  $f(x+\lambda(y-x))<=f(x)+\lambda(f(y)-f(x))$ applies. If you can substitute a $<$, then it is strictly convex.
- A function is called concave in an interval $I$ if for all $x,y \in I$ and all $\lambda: 0<\lambda<1$ 
  $f(x+\lambda(y-x)) â‰¥ f(x) + \lambda(f(y)-f(x))$ applies. If you can substitute a $>$ then it is strictly concave.

This relates to the second derivative[[20240926131117]] of the function $f$ $f''$. 
If f is continuous on an interval $I$ and differentiable two times in the inside of $I$, then f is convex(concave) if $f(x)>=0$($f(x)<=0$) for all $x \in (inner)I$. If both are true, then you are at a turning point ($f''(x)=0$).
