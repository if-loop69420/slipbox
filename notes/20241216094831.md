# What are the vector space axioms? 
The vector space axioms are the following 4 conditions an algebraic structure $(K, +, V)$ has to fulfill in order to be considered a vector space [[20241209090550]]:
$\forall x,y \in V: \forall \mu, \lambda \in K$:

1. $\lambda(x+y) = \lambda x + \lambda y$
2. $(\lambda + \mu)*x = \lambda x + \mu x$
3. $(\lambda \mu)x = \lambda (\mu x)$
4. $1*x = x$
