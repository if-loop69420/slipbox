# What is a geometric sequence? 
A geometric sequence $a_n$ is a series [[20241002211453]], that always grows by the same value.

For example $(a_n)_{n>=0}=q^n$ would be a geometric sequence always getting larger by q.

$a_n=2^n=\{1,2,4,8,16,...\}$.

A geometric series always has the following form: 
$\sum_{n>=0} q^n = 1 + q + q^2 + q^3 +â€¦$
