# What is the Taylor theorem? 
The taylor theorem is a theorem regarding taylor series' [[20241123141048]]. It states, that if a function $f$ is continuous in an interval $I$ $[x,x_0]$ and differentiable in $(x,x_0)$ and continously differentiable n-times on the inside $\mathring{I}$ of $I$ (n+1), then there is a number $\xi \in \mathring{I}$, so that 

$f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}}{k!}(a-b)^k + \frac{f^{(n+1)}\xi}{(n+1)!}(a-b)^{n+1}$.

The term $\frac{f^{(n+1)}\xi}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}$ is called the lagrangian remainder.
