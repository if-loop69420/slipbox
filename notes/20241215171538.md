# What is the main theorem for Integral and differential calculations? 
The main theorem for integral[[20241215165932]] and differential[[20241123130700]] calculation states the following: 
If $f$ is a continuous function in $[a,b]$, then there is a $\xi \in [a,b]$, so that $\int_a^b f(x) dx = f(\xi)(b-a)$.
