# What are extreme points of a function? 
A maxima of a function[[20240920132211]]  is a point $x_0$ where there is an environment left and right of the function, where no value is larger/smaller, than $f(x_0)$. 

If there is an environment, where everything is smaller, then the point is called a maxima.
If there is an environment, where everything is larger, then the point is called a minima.

The derivative at the point $x_0$, $f'(x_0)$ is equal to 0 if $x_0$ is an extreme point.
