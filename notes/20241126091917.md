# What is a factor group? 
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup[[20241126091641]] of a group[[20240929160535]] $G$. $G/N$ defines the set of cosets [[20241123123407]] from $G$ to $N$. Then $(a\circ N)\circ(b\circ N)=(a\circ b)\circ N$ is a group operation on $G/N$.
The group $(G/N, \circ)$ is called a factorgroup from $G$ to $N$.
