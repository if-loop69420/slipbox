# What is the dimension of a vector? 
The dimension of a vector[[20241209085931]] is the number of vectors in its base[[20241215172513]].

## Example 
$\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c\end{pmatrix}$ would have the dimension 3 because you would need exactly 3 linearly independent[[20241215171914]] vectors in order to generate a vector through their linear combination [[20241209092736]]
