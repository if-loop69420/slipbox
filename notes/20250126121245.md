# What is the solution of the particular part of a first order LDE?
The particular solution of a first order LDE [[20250126120127]] is found by using the solution of the homogenous part [[20250126120640]] and making the constant $C$ variable $y_p=C(x)*e^{-\int a(x)dx}$ and solving for $C(x)$.

1. $y_p' + a(x)y_p = C'(x)*e^{-\int a(x)dx}-a(x)C(x)e^{-\int a(x)dx}+a(x)C(x)e^{-\int a(x)dx} = s(x)$
2. $\implies C(x)=\int s(x)e^{\int a(x)dx}dx$
