# What is a vector space? 
A vector space is an algebraic structure [[20241111100144]] $(V,+,K)$ where $K$ is a field[[20241126093518]] and $(V, +)$ is an abelian group[[20240929160535]]. Each $\lambda \in K$ and $x \in V$ is assigned a product $\lambda * x \in V$. An algebraic structure of this kind is called a vector space if it fulfills the vector space axioms.
