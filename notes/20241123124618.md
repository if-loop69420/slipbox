# What is a symmetry group? 
The set $S_n$ of the permutations of the numbers $\{1,2,...,n\}$ is the set of bijective mappings $\pi: \{1,2,...,n\} \to \{1,2,...,n\}$.
If you apply two permutations to a sequence you receive another bijective mapping. $(S_n, \circ)$ is a so called symmetry group [[20240929160535]].
