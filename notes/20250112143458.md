# How can the angle between two vectors be calculated? 
The angle between two vectors [[20241209085931]] $x,y$ can be calculated by transforming the formula $<x,y>=\|x\| \|y\| \cos(\varphi)$ to $\frac{<x,y>}{\|x\| \|y\|} = \cos(\varphi)$. This works if you think about the vector as a point given in polar coordinates.

$x$ could be written as $(\|x\|*cos(\gamma), \|x\|*sin(\gamma))$ and y as $(\|y\|*cos(\delta), \|y\|*sin(\delta))$.
