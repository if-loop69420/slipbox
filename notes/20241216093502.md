# What is the exchange lemma? 
The exchange lemma states the following: 
Let $M = \{v_1, v_2, … , v_n\}$ be a set of vectors[[20241209085931]] and $a=\mu_1*v_1+...+\mu_n+v_n$ be a linear combination [[20241209092736]] of these vectors. Also let 
$M' = (M \setminus \{v_j\}) \cup \{a\}= \{v_1,...v_{j-1}, a, v_{j+1}, … v_n\}$ for a $j$ with $\mu_j\not = 0$. Then $M$ is linearly independent[[20241215171914]] if and only if $M'$ is linearly indepentend and $[M']=[M]$.

# What does this mean? 
If you have a base[[20241215172513]] $B$ of a vector space[[20241209090550]] $V$ and you have a linearly independent set $C$ you can swap elements of $C$ into $B$ and still get the same linear span and so on.
